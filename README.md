First of All : Be sure that you are using GPU in colab.

ðŸŽ¯Source codes of the shoe sole detection project. I developed when I worked as an computer vision engineer at Eurobotik. Code Language is Pyhton. YOLO version is v8 (latest version during project development). I used Roboflow to pull the data sets. You can use your own dataset with api keys or use my datasets from roboflow(https://app.roboflow.com/yolov8-hlm3z/detectingshoesolesyolov8/3). I used version2 of my dataset in this repo but you can use whatever you want the main difference between second and third is that classes; v3 has only 1 classes which is soles despite v2 have 3 classes. The main idea about reducing class number is to be more specific for  soles. Pay attention to the paths used in the project, update according to your own project status.

ðŸŽ¯With prediction.py you can use the live webcam application on any IDLE. Don't forget to add the best.py file that we previously created in Google Colab.

Angle.py = In this file, I took project one step further. In addition to the shoe sole, we can now estimate the angles.

Livecam.py = Alternative and modified live-time shoe sole angle and model finding. Correction of angle detection problems, %10 error solved.
