First of All : Be sure that you are using GPU in colab.

ðŸŽ¯Source codes of the shoe sole detection project. I developed when I worked as an computer vision engineer at Eurobotik. Code Language is Pyhton. YOLO version is v8 (latest version during project development). I used Roboflow to pull the data sets. You can use your own data set with api keys. Pay attention to the paths used in the project, update according to your own project status.

ðŸŽ¯With prediction.py you can use the live webcam application on any IDLE. Don't forget to add the best.py file that we previously created in Google Colab.

Angle.py = In this file, I took project one step further. In addition to the shoe sole, we can now estimate the angles.
